Developers working on projects that involve 3rd party translation companies could find this valuable. As request to add XLIFF support came just from developer in that situation. XLIFF format is supported for both - export of resources and also import. In order to add support for XLIFF format you will need to install following package - [DbLocalizationProvider.AdminUI.EPiServer.Xliff](http://nuget.episerver.com/en/OtherPages/Package/?packageId=DbLocalizationProvider.AdminUI.EPiServer.Xliff) from Episerver nuget freed.
