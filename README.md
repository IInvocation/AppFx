### How do I get set up? ###

* First - install the Nuget-CLI if you don't have it already (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/guides/install-nuget)
* Add a share called "nuget" that is accessible by "\\localhost\nuget\" (this is necessary, since this project is configured to automatically create nuget-packages)
